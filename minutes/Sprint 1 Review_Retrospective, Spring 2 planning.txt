All the objects, classes, and logic have been created 
- What wasn't accomplished?
Integration of the board, pieces, and logic 
- Were there unexpected obstacles and/or opportunities?
The piece logic is more complicated that originally anticipated 
- What should you keep doing?
Keep coding, keep designing, keep collaborating 
- What should you start doing?
Connect everything (theoretically with a management package)
- What should you stop doing?
Adding more classes until we connect everything
 
Sprint 2 Planning:
- Review any changes to the product backlog
Board logic, valid or invalid move checker, implement way to get location from string are closed. Still need to resolve current issues  
- Identify your sprint goal
Have everything connected and visually functioning game  
- Select items from the product backlog to fulfill that goal
Issue #4, integrating board pieces with board display.
