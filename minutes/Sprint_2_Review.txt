What was accomplished?
We were able to get a functioning board that would swap desired pieces and ensure that the piece belongs to the player and that the piece is being moved to a valid location on the board. 
A lot of the piece logic was complete
Got a functioning UI so we could test the code
Also implemented a functioning UI so we could see our design working. 

What wasn't accomplished?
What wasnâ€™t accomplished is uncommon cases like castling (swap king and rook after a certain combination has been reached) and Enpassant. These cases are just so unique, we need more time to create exceptions to our general rules. 

Were there unexpected obstacles and/or opportunities?
Unexpected obstacles were the uncommon cases of specific moves. We tried having a design that would handle general/common cases, and it made it tricky to handle these uncommon cases. 

What should you keep doing?
Communicating design decisions to each other
Following good git practices 
Communicating

What should you start doing?
Communicate a little better in regards to who is doing what
Try and establish a clearer path of our design patterns  

What should you stop doing?
Making classes without clearly discussing design first 
Spending too much time on side discussions when we our supposed to be discussion decision. (AKA I digress)
